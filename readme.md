# How it works
```
Crypter program use Fernet for encryption.
Fernet guarantees that a message encrypted using it cannot be manipulated or read without the key. 
Fernet is an implementation of symmetric (also known as “secret key”) 
authenticated cryptography.

Generates a fresh fernet key. Keep this some place safe! 
If you lose it you’ll no longer be able to decrypt files.
